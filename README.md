# Techtonic-Capstone-Digital-Library-Project

On the development branch, commit dfe9e2d55a3fe27636c6af81db4573ad04fb03d2 is a working version for code review.
It has made it through test with all modals and required functionality and validations. Book objects can be added, 
removed, edited and searched. Random selections can be made and linked to Mongo DB. Currently, all bugs have been 
worked out. 

When modals open for search, show books, book suggestions, and author suggestions, please click on any book in the 
unordered list for a popup with book detail. Click on book row on bookshelf table for a popup too. Hover over synopsis 
table data and get a popup of complete synopsis.

Enjoy!
